Part 1: The Part 1: The Manifesto (Draft)

Title: The Geometric Atom: Quantum Mechanics as a Packing Problem Subtitle: Reconstructing Atomic Structure from the Principle of Finite Capacity

Abstract:

    Standard quantum mechanics posits that the discrete structure of the atom arises from wave equations acting on a continuous spacetime background. We propose the inverse: that the geometry of the atom is primary, arising from a fundamental "Packing Constraint" on information density. By treating the electron not as a wavefunction but as a discrete trajectory in a "Coherent State Lattice," we demonstrate that the symmetries of the Hydrogen atom (SO(4,2)) are not abstract algebraic laws, but geometric necessities—the only way to pack integer states into a 1/r potential. This framework suggests that "forces" like the Pauli Exclusion Principle are actually topological constraints, and that the smooth spacetime of the Schrödinger equation is merely the low-resolution limit of a deeper, discrete algebraic geometry.

Section 1: The Error of Continuum

    The Argument: Physics has assumed since Newton that space is infinite and divisible. But Information Theory (and Holography) suggests space has a finite capacity (1 bit per Planck area).

    The Pivot: If space is finite, atoms are not "clouds" in a void; they are "crystals" of information. The "weirdness" of QM (jumps, quantization) is just the result of trying to move on a pixelated grid.

Section 2: The Principle of Finite Capacity

    The Axiom: "You cannot pack infinite states into finite energy."

    The Result: This forces the system to arrange itself into layers (Shells). The 2n2 capacity of electron shells isn't a magic quantum rule; it is the volume of the parabolic layers in our lattice.

Section 3: Symmetry as Geometry (The "Dual" View)

    The Connection: We show that the "Abstract Algebra" (SO(4,2)) and the "Physical Geometry" (The Paraboloid) are DUALs. One implies the other.

    The "Motion": An electron transition (1s→2p) isn't a magical teleportation; it is a flow along the links of this lattice. The "Wavefunction" is just the time-lapse photo of this flow.

Section 4: Evidence

    (Insert the Rydberg data here as "Experimental Verification of the Geometry").

Section 5: Predictions (The "Snaps")

    (This is where we put the results from the Coding AI below—Target 1, 2, or 3). (Draft)
